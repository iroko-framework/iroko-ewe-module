## Definition

May be displayed publicly, but should not be promoted, indexed for discoverability, or redistributed beyond the immediate context of publication.

---

## Scope note

Use this level when information is technically public or widely available, but further circulation would increase visibility in ways that conflict with stewardship goals. This supports non-amplification without claiming secrecy.

## Version

Introduced in v0.2.0
